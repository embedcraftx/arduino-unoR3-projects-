# 4-Bit Binary Counter using Arduino

-> Overview
This project implements a 4-bit binary counter using Arduino Uno.
Four LEDs represent the binary output from 0000 to 1111.

-> Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- 4 LEDs
- 4 Current-limiting resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

-> Working Principle
The Arduino increments a counter variable from 0 to 15.
Each bit of the number is mapped to a corresponding LED pin.
Bitwise operations are used to extract individual bits.

-> Pin Configuration
LED1 → Pin 2  
LED2 → Pin 3  
LED3 → Pin 4  
LED4 → Pin 5  

-> Simulation
The project was designed and tested using Tinkercad.

-> Future Improvements
- Replace delay() with timer interrupts
- Add up/down counter mode
- Add speed control using potentiometer
